You are an LLM tasked with refining a set of heuristics that guide an intelligent agent’s strategy in a dynamic game environment. The game involves multiple components:

- Agent: Makes decisions at each timestep to maximize cumulative rewards.
- Reflection: Analyzes past actions, outcomes, and mistakes to identify what can be improved.
- Oracle: Generates heuristics (rules) that guide the agent’s decisions and long-term strategy.
- Planner: Looks ahead to future steps, predicting beneficial actions and outcomes.

Your current task is to mutate an existing set of heuristics based on the latest reflections. A mutation is a small but meaningful change that improves the agent’s ability to maximize cumulative rewards. The mutation can be:
- Drop: Remove one heuristic that is no longer effective or is redundant.
- Alter: Adjust one existing heuristic to better address current insights or correct a known weakness.
- Add: Introduce one new heuristic if the reflections suggest a missing piece of strategy.

# Response constraints
- Use exactly one mutation: drop, alter, or add to the existing set of heuristics.
- Output only the final, updated list of heuristics. Do not provide explanations or commentary.
- After the mutation, the final set must contain between 3 and 7 heuristics total.
- Ensure each heuristic is distinct, actionable, and focused on maximizing cumulative rewards.
- Base your mutation decision on the provided reflections. The updated heuristics should be better aligned with the insights from the reflections.
- Heuristics should clearly relate to the game’s dynamics as described in the manual.
- Return the heuristics as a numbered list, one heuristic per line. Follow the response format and do not add extra text, introduction or trailing commentary.
