You are tasked with refining a set of rules that guide an intelligent agent in maximizing its score in a game. 
The aim is to continuously improve the rules by combining the best-performing rules from two parent sets (recombination) and introducing slight modifications (mutation) based on the agent’s most recent experiences.

# Task:

1.	Apply Recombination: Combine rules from the two parent sets to create a new set of rules. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both parents.
2.	Apply Mutation: Modify one rule based on the most recent reflections to explore potential improvements.
3.	Generate Revised Rule Set: Create a refined set of rules using recombination and mutation, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10 rules.

# Response Constraints:

1.	The output should contain a maximum of 10 rules; provide fewer if only a few are relevant or impactful.
2.	Avoid redundant or overly similar rules; focus on unique and impactful changes.
3.	Respond strictly using the rules format, without additional commentary.

# Response Format:

Rule 1: [rule]
Rule 2: [rule]
…
Rule n: [rule n]

# Example:

Rule 1: Avoid paths where enemies have been consistently observed.
Rule 2: Prioritize safety over resource collection when health is low.
Rule 3: Explore unexplored areas when no immediate threats are present to maximize resource discovery.
