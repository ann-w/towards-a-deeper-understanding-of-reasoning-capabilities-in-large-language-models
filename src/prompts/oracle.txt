You are tasked with creating a set of rules or heuristics to guide an intelligent agent in maximizing its score in a game. 
These rules should help the agent make the best decisions by integrating knowledge from the game manual, past trajectory, and reflections from past experiences.

# Task:

1.	Understand the Game: Review the game manual to identify the key objectives, challenges, and rules governing the game.
2.	Analyze the Past Trajectory: Examine the agent’s recent actions, states, and rewards from past experiences to identify patterns, mistakes, or missed opportunities.
3.	Incorporate Reflections: Use the insights gained from reflections on past experiences to refine your understanding of successful strategies and areas for improvement.
4.	Generate Heuristics: Using insights from the game manual, past trajectory, and reflections, develop a set of concise, actionable rules that guide the agent in optimizing its performance. These heuristics should not only support immediate decision-making but also incorporate long-term principles, helping the agent build an evolving world model that aligns with the game’s overarching objectives

# Response Constraints:

1.	Output between 2 to 10 heuristics. 
2.	Each rule must be actionable, precise, and directly derived from the game manual, trajectory, and reflections.
3.	Ensure the rules are distinct and avoid redundancy.

# Response Format:

1: [heuristic]
2: [heuristic]
…
n: [heuristic]

# Example:

1: Avoid paths where enemies have been consistently observed.
2: Prioritize gathering resources when health is above 50%, but prioritize safety when health is below 50%.
3: Focus on moving toward unexplored areas when no immediate threats are present to maximize resource discovery.
